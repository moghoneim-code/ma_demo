# Flutter Assessment Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Flutter application that fetches data from an API, parses the response into a model, and integrates with native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) code to display platform-specific bottom sheets. Additionally, it implements one-state management, supports both dark and light modes, caches responses for offline use, and includes unit tests along with end-to-end testing for button clicks.

## Project Tasks

1. **Fetching and Parsing Data:**
   Data is fetched from a specified API endpoint and parsed into a model to be used within the application.

2. **Data Model:**
   A model has been created to represent the structure of the API response.

3. **State Management:**
   Provider State management is implemented to manage the application's state effectively.

4. **Design and Theming:**
   The application supports both dark and light modes, adhering to the specified design style.

5. **Reusable Widget:**
   Most of the application's UI is implemented using a single reusable widget.

6. **Native Code Integration:**
   Integration with native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) code is implemented to show platform-specific bottom sheets.

7. **Data Caching:**
   The application caches the API response to ensure functionality even when offline.

8. **Comments and Documentation:**
   The codebase is thoroughly documented, including comments explaining various sections, functions, and design choices.

9. **Unit Tests:**
   Unit tests are written to verify the functionality of different components within the application. Additionally, end-to-end tests are implemented specifically for button clicks.

## Project Flow

1. **Open Reservation:**
   Opens a Flutter bottom sheet displaying reservation details.

2. **Show iOS Ticket:**
   Opens a native iOS bottom sheet displaying ticket information.

3. **Show Android Ticket:**
   Opens a native Kotlin bottom sheet displaying ticket information.
